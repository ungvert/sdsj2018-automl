# 10th place solution to Sberbank Data Science Journey 2018: AutoML

[SDSJ AutoML](https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/contest) â€” AutoML(automatic machine learning) competition aimed at development of machine learning systems for processing banking datasets: transactions, time-series as well as classic table data from real banking operations.
Processing is handled automatically by the system with models selection, architecture, hyper-parameters, etc.

# Solution description

Based on [@tyz910](https://github.com/tyz910/) 's public [kernel](https://github.com/tyz910/sdsj2018)

## Preprocessing:

All preprocessing procedures prallelized.

- If dataset's size bigger than 2Gb -> filtering columns with Boruta
- Drop constant columns
- Add is_na columns
- Filling na values and downcasting
- Extracting features from datetime columns
- Target encoding for `string` columns

## Training:

While we have time:

1. Sample LightGBM hyperparameters and K-fold parameters(`n_splits`, `shuffle`)
2. Construct folds as subset from main train LightGBM dataset
3. Train all folds with LightGBM
4. Minimize oof-score with HyperOpt
4. Save all models and train another CV cycle if have time
